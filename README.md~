# Neovim
This is my personal configuration of Neovim.
I try to keep it simple but functional.
# Installation
- Clone the repository into your `~/.config/` folder
`git clone https://github.com/IgnaceMenace/nvim`
- Run nvim and check the health of your Neovim installation by typing in the Neovim command line
`:checkhealth`
